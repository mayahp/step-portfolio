                <h2>Picking Up Old Hobbies</h2>
                <p>Now that I've started my internship, I'm starting to create a weekly schedule for myself.  Unlike the school year, I am able to have a stricter distinction between work time and relaxing time.  I like to play with jigsaw puzzles whenever I have free time, which is usually when I come home from college for break.  Now that I can carve out some more free time for myself, I'd like to start playing with my puzzles again.  I have a lot of Disney-themed puzzles that are very intricate, and are up to 1000 pieces each.</p>

                <h2>Starting STEP Internship</h1>
                <p>I started my STEP internship on May 18th.  I was very excited to set up my WFH workstation in my room.  I am lucky to have friends who are also interning at Google this summer, and friends who are full-timers.  On my first day, while I set up, I sent my friends some messages.  Despite the distance that separates me from my friends, my team, and other Google employees, I feel that everyone is doing their part of connect with one another.  I think that I'll have a great summer!

                <h2>Halfway Done With College</h2>
                <p>I finished my finals for the Spring 2020 semester during the second week of May.  One of the classes that I finished was Data Structures and Algorthms.  This means that I am done with the introductory computer science class sequence at Penn, which starts with Intro to Computer Science and ends with Data Structures and Algorthms.  I'm proud of myself for hitting this milestone, as it is four semesters in the making!  I also finished two other computer science courses this semester.  I'm happy that, despite the unexpected shift to remote learning in the middle of the semester, I was still able to do well in my classes and enjoy the work that I was doing.  However, I do hope we can shift back to in-person learning safely and soon.
