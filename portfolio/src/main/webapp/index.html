            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>Hi!  I'm Maya, a rising junior at the University of Pennsylvania.  I'm navigating the tech industry with a passion for learning new things and teaching others along the way.
                <br><br>I'm currently working from home in Colts Neck, NJ.  I have two younger sisters who are both in high school.  I'm spending lockdown by playing board games with them, completing jigsaw puzzles, and organizing virtual game nights with my college friends.  I am not only the oldest one in the family, but also the oldest of all of my immediate cousins on both sides of my family.  (On my mom's side of the family, I'm the oldest of the entire new generation of kids!)  Since almost all of my extended family immigrated to the USA in the 70s and 80s, I've been close with them for my whole life.
                <br><br>At school, I am a teaching assistant in the Computer Science department, a board member of PennApps (Penn's yearly hackathon, and the original college hackathon), a member of Zeta Tau Alpha Sorority, and involved with my school's South Asian American and Hindu communities.  I enjoy teaching computer science because I believe in making CS as accessible to as many people as possible.
